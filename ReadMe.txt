The purpose of this project is to develop software for the Microsoft HoloLens. As this is a software engineering
class, our goal is to make a prototype that can showcase the capabilities of such technology.

As of February 6th, 2017, we have been able to display a hologram in 3-D space and rotate it at a given point.
The next milestone is to incorporate vector cross products to allow the point of rotation to be wherever the 
user is standing opposed to being static.
